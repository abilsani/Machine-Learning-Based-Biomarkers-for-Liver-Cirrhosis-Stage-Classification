Overview
Liver cirrhosis is a progressive disease that can eventually lead to liver failure if not diagnosed early. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on invasive procedures. This project aims to apply machine learning models to clinical biomarkers to:

Classify cirrhosis stages accurately.

Discover significant biomarkers.

Reduce the dependency on invasive diagnostic procedures.

Dataset
The dataset includes clinical and laboratory data of patients at different stages of liver cirrhosis.
Features may include (examples):

Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin)

Coagulation profiles

Complete blood counts

Demographics

Note: Ensure compliance with data privacy and usage regulations if using real patient data.

Installation

Modeling Approach
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, feature selection.

Feature Engineering: Identification of significant biomarkers.

Modeling: Several models tested, such as:

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Neural Networks

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Results
Initial results show that [Model X] achieved an accuracy of YY% in classifying cirrhosis stages.
Further optimization and hyperparameter tuning are ongoing to improve the model performance.
